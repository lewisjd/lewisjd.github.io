            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>As a physics student at the University of Bath, I initially had very little exposure to coding. However, after learning Python 
            in my first year, I became increasingly interested in coding and decided to take a course on C programming to prepare for my second 
            year. I quickly became enamored with coding and realized how useful it was for data analysis, simulations, and interfacing with equipment, 
            such as with the Arduino. </p>
            <p>Throughout my coursework, I have worked on several coding projects, including data analysis and implementing numerical methods. 
            One project that I am particularly proud of is creating code to execute the downhill simplex method in multiple dimensions using 
            C programming.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build on my existing coding skills. I recently created this simple website 
            to showcase my coding projects and am working on creating games as a personal project. For example, I have already made a recreation of the 2048 
            game.</p>
            <p>As for my goals and aspirations in coding, I am still exploring where I want to take my skills. My aim is to gain more experience 
            and broaden my knowledge to find where I can best apply my coding skills, whether that be in physics or another field.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring my other hobbies and interests, such as going to the gym and reading. Through my work and 
            collaboration with others in research and projects, I hope to contribute to the broader scientific/tech community and use my skills 
            to help clients or employers achieve their goals.</p>
