            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>As a physics student at the University of Bath, my initial exposure to coding was limited. However, after learning Python in my first year, I became fascinated and decided to pursue a course in C programming to prepare for my second year. I soon realized the immense potential of coding for data analysis, simulations, and interfacing with equipment, such as Arduino.</p>
            <p>Throughout my coursework, I have engaged in various projects involving data analysis and numerical methods implementation. One project I am particularly proud of involved executing the downhill simplex method in multiple dimensions using C programming. After numerous iterations and modifications, I was delighted with the outcome, making the effort worthwhile.</p>
            <p>I am currently expanding my coding skills by learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I recently developed a simple website to showcase my projects and have started creating games, such as a 2048 game recreation.</p>
            <p>While I am still exploring my coding goals and aspirations, my aim is to gain experience and broaden my knowledge to discover the best application of my abilities, be it in physics or another domain.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy pursuing hobbies like going to the gym and reading. I also engage in language learning, currently attempting Japanese at a steady pace. Through research and collaborative projects, I aspire to contribute to the broader scientific/tech community and utilize my skills to help clients or employers achieve their objectives.</p>
